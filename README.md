This homework will introduce some theory for OOP. Please read about Universal Modelling Language Class diagram under the link provided below.

After carefully reading this material, please think about a small project You can design. It can be a part of organisational structure in your company (if you already work), or a system to enable interaction between players of a board games/computer games, whatever you wish. Please create:

Class diagram with at least 4 classes; Each class should have defined their attributes and methods (with in and out parameters).

Determine relationships between classes. Include at least 3 common relationship type (inheritance, association, composition etc.)

Draw your diagram using this tool: https://app.diagrams.net/ or similar.

Create new directory called "Project" and as many files as you have classes. Make sure each file can "communicate" with the other (e.g. that we can access the "target" class in a source class using a Python module structure)

For now, do not worry about the implementation of the relationships.
Please upload .png file with you diagram and the directory with your project.
